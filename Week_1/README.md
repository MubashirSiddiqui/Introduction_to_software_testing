# Week 1
## Overview
1. Validation
2. Verification
3. Validation
4. Verification
5. ```It checks the whole system``` and ```It documents system behavior```

## On the difficulty of software testing
1. Continuous systems are simpler to test because you can often extrapolate test results from one point to points 'nearby'.
2. ```A  = 5, X = 5, N = 5``` and ```A  = 1, X = 10, N = 1```
3. Optimistic
4. No

## What is a Test?
1. A program that automatically matches the actual program output to the expected output of the test case.
2. True
3. ```Remove data you added after testing is done``` and ```Close connection after testing is done```
4. Software output is checked by an oracle.

## Automation: Using a Test Framework
1. ```They allow automated``` and ```They run all test cases``` and ```They allow programmers```
2. all
3. ```In a separate class```

## Automation: Writing JUnit Tests
1. all
2. The main method.
3. False.
4. A good idea. Test cases should be built based on the expected output and should not be influenced by the implementation.
5. All test cases need to be run including the new one.
